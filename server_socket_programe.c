        sin_family	    Address family (IPv4)
        sin_addr.s_addr	IP address
        sin_port	    Port number


        Why cast to (struct sockaddr *)?
The bind() function expects the second argument to be:

const struct sockaddr *
But address is of type:

struct sockaddr_in
So, you need to typecast it like this:

(struct sockaddr *)&address
This is a common pattern in C networking to handle different address types using the generic sockaddr type.

3. sizeof(address)
It tells the size (in bytes) of the structure you're passing as the address.

In this case, it's the size of struct sockaddr_in.

This helps bind() know how many bytes to read from the address you provide.

Argument	Purpose
server_fd	The socket file descriptor (int)
(struct sockaddr *)&address	The serverâ€™s IP and port (with cast)
sizeof(address)	Size of the address structure in bytes

    // 3. Listen for connections
    listen(server_fd, 3);
    /*Puts the server socket in listening mode.
    3 means max 3 pending connections in queue.*/
    printf("Server is listening on port %d...\n", PORT);//Displays a message that the server is now waiting for connections.

    // 4. Accept connection
    new_socket = accept(server_fd, (struct sockaddr *)&address, (socklen_t*)&addrlen);

            /* Accepts an incoming connection from a client.
            new_socket is used to communicate with the connected client.
            (socklen_t *)&addrlen
addrlen is an integer that holds the size of the address structure.

accept() will use it to:

Know how many bytes to read into address.

Fill it with the actual size of the client's address after the connection is accepted.

Since accept() requires a pointer to socklen_t, we write:

(socklen_t *)&addrlen
ðŸ§  What Happens in This Call?

new_socket = accept(server_fd, (struct sockaddr *)&address, (socklen_t*)&addrlen);
The server is waiting for a client to connect on server_fd.

When a client connects:

The clientâ€™s IP and port info are filled into address.

The size of the address is stored in addrlen.

A new socket (new_socket) is returned to handle communication with this client.

Summary Table:
Part	What it Does
server_fd	The listening socket (server is waiting for clients)
(struct sockaddr *)&address	Where client's IP/port will be stored after connection
(socklen_t *)&addrlen	Pointer to size of address and filled with actual size

0 is a flag (usually kept 0 for basic use).*/
